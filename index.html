                Rain and panic are now synonymous with the people of Sylhet who have been suffering for an indefinite
                period of time. With the exception of relatively high elevations, most of the area is flooded. River
                erosion is taking place in Sunamganj, Companiganj and other haor areas. There is no network coverage,
                even the tin rice is completely submerged. Kanaighat, Zakiganj, Gowainghat, Chhatak under water. The
                situation in some places is so deplorable that the army has been called in to rescue them.
