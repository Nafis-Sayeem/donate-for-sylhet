                Rain and panic are now synonymous with the people of Sylhet who have been suffering for an indefinite
                period of time. With the exception of relatively high elevations, most of the area is flooded. River
                erosion is taking place in Sunamganj, Companiganj and other haor areas. There is no network coverage,
                even the tin rice is completely submerged. Kanaighat, Zakiganj, Gowainghat, Chhatak under water. The
                situation in some places is so deplorable that the army has been called in to rescue them.

        <p class="section-2-p">There is no electricity for hours on end. Gas and water supply cut off in many places.
            The
            younger members of
            the family are getting sick. Traffic has also been reduced due to knee-deep water. Which is blocking the way
            of income of low income people. Many are forced to leave their homes and look for a place to live. Moreover,
            the tube wells have been submerged, causing a crisis of pure water. Things that are urgently needed in this
            situation</p>
